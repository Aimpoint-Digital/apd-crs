apd-crs is a Python package for survival analysis with cure rate. I.e. time-to-event analysis using a dataset for which outcomes of a fraction of the dataset are unknown (censored), and for which some individuals never experience the event. For example, a medical trial where time since diagnosis is measured and some participants drop out during the trial period, some of which are cured. Or a manufacturing dataset where time-to-failure since maintenance is measured, and some equipment takes so long to fail that it “never sees” the event. Currently there are three methods available for estimating the cure probability per covariate: either by k-means clustering, using the selected completely at random (SCAR) assumption, or using a Hard EM algorithm. Since the cure probability is fitted independently of the times to event/censoring, this package can also be used for PU learning. I.e. binary classification with positive and unlabeled data. apd-crs is a work in progress and maintained by a team of researchers and developers from Aimpoint Digital.
